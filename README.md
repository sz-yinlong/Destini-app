*This one is the first app that I made completely on my own without any tutorial - only a brief explanation is given of what it should look like and how it's supposed to work.

Took me 3 days to grasp the very concepts of MVC but more importnatly how to pass data through Controller to View and Model.
Also helped me to get the essenece of the functions that returns values aka computed properties

** Initial design is made by AppBrewery
